I am a software engineer from Copenhagen. I am passionate about UX, performance and accessibility, and I like React, systems design, and static type systems. I am unafraid to dive into uncharted waters, and love to develop my skills and learn new technologies.

## Proficiencies

My main proficiencies include:

- Modern JavaScript & TypeScript development.
- Modern front end frameworks, primarily React.
- Accessibility testing.
- Full-stack development; e.g. with Node.js, and (a little bit of) Ruby and Rails.
- GraphQL; but also REST.
- Javascript bundlers, e.g., Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, @swc, esbuild, and the likes.
- SQL and NoSQL databases, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL.
- Testing; primarily using Jest, react-testing-library, and Cypress.io.
- HTML and CSS, also.

And some of the stuff I'm keen on learning more about:

- Rust.
