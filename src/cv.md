I am a full-stack developer from Copenhagen, currently working at Zendesk. I am passionate about accessibility, performance, and user experience, and I like React, GraphQL, and static type systems. I believe in finding the right tools for the job, and I am not afraid to dive into uncharted waters. I love to learn, and am constantly trying out new tech. I'm currently thinking a lot about TypeScript, Rust, Deno, OCaml (occasionally) and similar tech.

I am looking for opportunities working on strongly-typed codebases, with a high regard for reliability and maintainability, and a down-to-earth, passionate culture.

I am 29 years old, and live in the North Western neighborhood of Copenhagen with my fiancé. I enjoy brewing coffee — _the nerdy way_; playing and listening to music, and working on all sorts of programming side projects to hone my skills as a developer, and learn new tools and languages.

## Proficiencies

My main proficiencies include:

- Modern JavaScript & TypeScript development.
- Modern front end frameworks, primarily React.
- Accessibility testing.
- Full-stack development; e.g. with Node.js, and (a little bit of) Ruby and Rails.
- GraphQL; but also REST.
- Javascript bundlers, e.g., Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, @swc, esbuild, and the likes.
- SQL and NoSQL databases, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL.
- Testing; primarily using Jest, react-testing-library, and Cypress.io.
- HTML and CSS, also.

And some of the stuff I'm keen on learning more about:

- Rust.
- Functional paradigms.
- Docker.
- OCaml/ReasonML/ReScript.
