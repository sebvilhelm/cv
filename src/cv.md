I am a software engineer from Copenhagen, where I live with my wife and daughter. I am passionate about UX, performance and accessibility, and I like React, systems design, and static type systems. I am unafraid to dive into uncharted waters, and love to develop my skills and learn new technologies.

## Proficiencies

I'm a software engineer, who's spent most of my professional time on front-end, crossing the boundary towards back-end mostly to develop APIs. I don't identify myself to a particular part of the stack, though, because to me, each boundary is only a part of the entire machine, that works most efficiently when each part plays well into each-others strengths.

I've been using React professionally for 5 years, and GraphQL almost as-long. I'm very keen on both technologies, but I'm not blind to their trade-offs. No technology is a silver bullet.

For back-end technologies I've spent the most time in Node.js servers, but also some times in Ruby on Rails, Go servers, and in my spare time I'm currently learning Rust.
